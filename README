NUUSH
=====

Nuush is a shell script that lets you to keep track of your web feeds and
read them on your terminal. In short, it's a command line feed reader. It
has a really simple interface and it's very configurable.

The script has been tested with Bash and Ksh93, both on BSD (NetBSD) and
Linux (Debian). Besides common Unix tools (e.g., awk, grep, sed) you will
need XMLStarlet: http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/

Nuush is free and unencumbered public domain software. For more information,

NOTE: So far, nuush has worked fine. However, it's a work in progress so
expect some bugs.
